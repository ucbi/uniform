# Benefits and Disadvantages

`Eject` is not just a library. It's an entire paradigm and system for organizing
and synchronizing a suite of applications.

The `Eject` paradigm is not for everyone, but it can be very powerful in
environments where a team or developer is tasked with developing a large base
of applications that have many similarities or could share a lot of
functionality.

## Benefits

- **Higher leverage to maintain a portfolio of applications** - the ROI scales
  with the number of applications managed this way. When you add a new
  capability, refactor deprecations, or change an implementation, the results
  are automatically incorporated into all of your applications!
- **Reduce dependency drift** - this is achieved by only setting dependencies
  on the primary application and all ejected applications get a subset of those
  dependencies. This constraint eliminates the problem of having multiple dep
  versions in use across an portfolio and having to grapple with missing
  features or incompatible apis.
- Faster feedback - when you change anything shared, your changes are
  automatically made and tested into all applications that could be impacted
- **Defer factoring decisions** - In the interest of the DRY principle, there
  is a motivation to abstract and modularize the moment we start adding a
  feature. This can often turn out to be a cross cutting concern in a way we
  didn't anticipate resulting an an abstraction that leaks or is otherwise
  ill-suited to the specific use case. As a result, there's advocacy for the
  WET principle (Write Everything Twice), which is about using the same ideas
  multiple times to get a real feel for the common API. Using the ejector
  pattern, there are no distinct packages to create up front which makes it
  much easier to refactor as the API evolves. Indeed, this very library started
  as a single module in the lib directory and is on its third implementation.
- **Share capabilities with lower overhead** - using the pattern, any
  capability that is developed for a specific ejected application can be lifted
  to the lib level and is instantly available to all other applications in the
  portfolio.
- **Global Refactors** - When the entire portfolio of applications is managed
  together, we're free to refactor any interal API and know that we've gotten
  all invocations across the enterprise. This eliminates the burden of
  maintaining backwards compatibility.
- **Self-Healing Properties** - Since `mix eject` starts by deleting the
  contents of the destination codebase, it's possible to modify an ejected
  codebase temporarily, and then "bring it back in sync" with your Base Project
  by running `mix eject` again. Ejecting an app with `mix eject` is meant to be
  something that can be done over and over without preparation or ceremony.

## Disadvantages

- **Novelty** By far the biggest disadvantage is the novelty. When new
  developers join the team, or if you have an open-source application suite,
  contributors have to learn this new way of working.
- **No Single Ejected App Participation** There's no way, currently, to have
  someone contribute changes in an ejected application and integrate them back
  into the primary repository. This means, to maintain all the benefits of the
  unified repo contributors need access to the entire portfolio.
- **Inconsistent Routing** Routes don't match between primary and ejected
  application environments. There's only one root route in the primary, so when
  you're developing specific applications from the primary repo, all routes
  have a prefix. This means you need 100% reliance on route helpers and a hard
  coded route will probably take you to the wrong place either in development
  or post ejections.
- **Compile Times** Full recompiles can take a really long time for a big
  portfolio of application. Elixir 1.13 has helped out tremendously in this
  regard, but when you're changing config that maybe only has relevance to a
  single application - you still end up with a full recompile of lots of
  unaffected code.
- **CI Burn Rate** - Because we test every change, on every commit, on every
  application, we burn through CI minutes.
