# Use Cases

## From a High Level

Uniform is powerful in scenarios in which you want to:

1. Maintain a portfolio of applications.
2. Deploy them separately.
3. Keep many aspects of them in sync.
4. Share capabilities between apps.

This makes Uniform especially powerful for software organizations that do not
have an entire team dedicated to each application.

## Enterprises

In our specific use case, we build and maintain applications across companies
for a large enterprise. The companies have their own distinct branding, themes,
deployment pipelines, and assurance processes. However, they share data access
patterns, UI libraries, authentication mechanisms, and many other common
features.

By leveraging Uniform, we're able to perform many changes to our entire
portfolio of applications in the time that it would take to make the change to
a single application. For example, when we find a security issue in our shared
application architecture, we patch it once and all apps are instantly updated.
What could have been a lengthy, involved auditing and patching process across
dozens of apps becomes much simpler and less time-intensive.

Uniform also helps us accomplish _sharing capabilities_ among apps. In the
process of building an application, we create a UI component for suggesting
results as the user types. Without any extra effort, since our UI library is
shared among all applications, this component becomes instantly available in
all other apps.

## Agencies

Agencies that build custom applications for multiple independent clients often
find themselves squeezed for time as they try to balance budget and time
constraints. They're often left needing to make hard calls about whether there
is enough time and money to add features or capabilities.

Uniform can help an agency leverage as much value as possible from their
portfolio of already-built applications as they start new projects. Instead of
rebuilding core pieces like project boilerplate, authentication systems, or
integrations with third party services, those capabilities are available from
the start. (As long as they're built with sharing in mind.)

Furthermore, since Uniform emits standalone codebases for each application, an
agency is able to leverage this extreme level of reuse while still having
separate codebases that belong to each client.
