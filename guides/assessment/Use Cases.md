# Use Cases

You need to maintain a portfolio of applications that may be entirely independent of each other. You want things to be done consistently throughout them, though they may have some necessarily unique features. You want leverage as you maintain this portfolio.

In our specifc use case, we build and maintain applications across companies for a large enterprise. The companies have their own distinct branding, themes, deployment pipelines, and assurance processes. However, they share data access patterns, ui libraries, authentication mechanisms, and many other common features.

This would also be true in an agency setting where the agency typically builds things a certain way but each company and domain brings unique requirements.
