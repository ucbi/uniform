Imagine creating an entire new application simply by adding a Route and a
single LiveView to an existing Elixir project.

This is in fact the vision that drove the creation of Uniform. The overhead of
experimenting with new apps becomes extremely low, incentivizing the team to
try out ideas without being inhibited by initial setup time.

## Setting up your Blueprint module

Below is an example [Blueprint](Uniform.Blueprint.html) module for ejecting the files
common to Phoenix applications.

```elixir
defmodule MyBaseApp.Uniform.Blueprint do
  use Uniform.Blueprint, templates: "lib/my_base_app/uniform/templates"

  base_files do
    cp_r "assets"
    cp_r "priv/static"

    file "lib/my_base_app_web.ex"
    file Path.wildcard("config/**/*.exs")
    file Path.wildcard("test/support/*_case.ex")
  end

  deps do
    # Always eject the `my_base_app` and `my_base_app_web` libraries.
    #
    # Their paths and file contents will replace my_base_app with the ejected
    # app name automatically.
    always do
      lib :my_base_app do
        only [
          "lib/my_base_app/application.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app/repo.ex"
        ]

        # `match_dot: true` so that we eject `priv/repo/.formatter.exs`
        file Path.wildcard("priv/repo/**/*.exs", match_dot: true)
      end

      lib :my_base_app_web do
        only [
          "lib/my_base_app_web/endpoint.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/gettext.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/router.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/telemetry.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/channels/user_socket.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/templates/layout/app.html.heex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/templates/layout/live.html.heex"
          "lib/my_base_app_web/templates/layout/root.html.heex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/views/error_helpers.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/views/error_view.ex",
          "lib/my_base_app_web/views/layout_view.ex"
        ]
      end
    end
  end
end
```

Let's walk through it step by step.

## The `base_files` section

```elixir
base_files do
  cp_r "assets"
  cp_r "priv/static"

  file "lib/my_base_app_web.ex"
  file Path.wildcard("config/**/*.exs")
  file Path.wildcard("test/support/*_case.ex")
end
```

In the [base_files](Uniform.Blueprint.html#base_files/1) section, we specify
files that should _always_ be ejected in every app. Phoenix apps will typically
have CSS and JS assets in the `assets` directory. They'll also have static
files to be served as-is in `priv/static`. Some of these files are binary
(non-text) files, and we assume none of them need to pass through the [Code
Transformation](code-transformations.html) phase. That's why the first two
lines are included.

```elixir
cp_r "assets"
cp_r "priv/static"
```

Note that `cp_r` instructs `mix uniform.eject` to copy all the directory
contents (using `File.cp_r!/3`).

Phoenix apps typically have an `Web` module which is used to construct
Controllers, Views, Routers, and LiveViews. Since this file is typically in
`lib/` directly (and not in a sub-directory of `lib/`), we include it here in
the `base_files` section.

```elixir
file "lib/my_base_app_web.ex"
```

We also proceed with the assumption that the ejected app will need the Base
Project's configuration files.

```elixir
file Path.wildcard("config/**/*.exs")
```

## The `deps` section

In the `deps` section, we put both `lib :my_base_app` and `lib
:my_base_app_web` inside `always do` so that their contents are always ejected
without having to specify `lib_deps: [:my_base_app, :my_base_app_web]` in the
`uniform.exs` manifest of every app.

```elixir
deps do
  always do
    lib :my_base_app do
      # ...
    end

    lib :my_base_app_web do
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

For `:my_base_app`, we use an `only` instruction to exclude all files in
`lib/my_base_app` and `test/my_base_app` except for `application.ex` and
`repo.ex`.

```elixir
lib :my_base_app do
  only [
    "lib/my_base_app/application.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app/repo.ex"
  ]

  file Path.wildcard("priv/repo/**/*.exs", match_dot: true)
end
```

You may have a setup that requires you to add more files, such as `mailer.ex`.

Note that we also include all of the Repo's migrations and seeds scripts with
`file Path.wildcard(...)`. The `match_dot: true` ensures
`priv/repo/.formatter.exs` is ejected so that the ejected codebase is formatted
properly.

For `:my_base_app_web`, we also use an `only` instruction to only include
relevant files.

```elixir
lib :my_base_app_web do
  only [
    "lib/my_base_app_web/endpoint.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/gettext.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/router.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/telemetry.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/channels/user_socket.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/templates/layout/app.html.heex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/templates/layout/live.html.heex"
    "lib/my_base_app_web/templates/layout/root.html.heex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/views/error_helpers.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/views/error_view.ex",
    "lib/my_base_app_web/views/layout_view.ex"
  ]
end
```

## The Phoenix Router

A simple way to set up your `Phoenix.Router` is to use [Code
Fences](code-transformations.html#code-fences) and
`Uniform.Blueprint.modify/2`.

Routes for all of your apps are all placed in the router, with two caveats:

1. Routes are wrapped in [Code Fences](code-transformations.html#code-fences)
   so that they're removed when other apps are ejected.
2. Paths are prefixed with `/app-name` so that each app exists at a nice URL
   for development. The prefixes are removed with `modify`.

```elixir
defmodule MyBaseAppWeb.Router do
  use MyBaseAppWeb, :router

  pipeline :browser do
    # ...
  end

  # uniform:remove

  # Place "internal pages" that should never be ejected here.
  # See "Internal Pages" below this code example.
  scope "/", SomeAppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/internal-team-page", InternalTeamController, :index
  end

  # /uniform:remove

  # uniform:app:some_app
  scope "/some-app", SomeAppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/widgets", WidgetController, :index
    get "/widgets/new", WidgetController, :new
    post "/widgets/new", WidgetController, :create
    get "/widgets/:widget_id", WidgetController, :show
  end
  # /uniform:app:some_app

  # uniform:app:another_app
  scope "/another-app", SomeAppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    get "/widgets", WidgetController, :index
    get "/widgets/new", WidgetController, :new
    post "/widgets/new", WidgetController, :create
    get "/widgets/:widget_id", WidgetController, :show
  end
  # /uniform:app:another_app
end
```

```elixir
defmodule MyBaseApp.Uniform.Blueprint do
  use Uniform.Blueprint, templates: "..."

  modify "lib/my_base_app_web/router.ex", fn file, app ->
    String.replace(
      file,
      "scope \"/#{app.name.hyphen}\"",
      "scope \"/\""
    )
  end
end
```

The Code Fences (comments like this: `# uniform:app:some_app`) will cause the
code to be removed when ejecting a different app. The simple code transformer
defined with `modify` changes

```elixir
scope "/some-app", SomeAppWeb do
```

To

```elixir
scope "/", SomeAppWeb do
```

In the ejected codebase.

This method is a great starting point. Once you reach dozens of apps, you may
want to consider other methods that allow you to branch out to more separation
in your Router.

### Internal Pages

Since you're adopting a model that serves all of your applications from a
single server in the development environment, it can be useful to add other
pages that aren't intended to be ejected with any app. For example, a page that
catalogs and links to your various apps.

We recommend adding these as often as you like, and wrapping them all in
`# uniform:remove` Code Fences as in the example above.

## Code Fences Everywhere!

There are other files crucial for Elixir apps, such as `application.ex`,
`mix.exs`, and `config/*.exs` files.

Similarly to the Phoenix Router, we recommend adding all of the code needed for
every application and [Lib Dependency](dependencies.html#lib-dependencies) to
each of these places and using [Code
Fences](code-transformations.html#code-fences) to remove code that isn't needed
for any given application.

### Application

Your `Application` file at `lib/my_base_app/application.ex` is a critical piece
of Elixir applications since it's used to start processes and supervisors at
the start of the application.

Here's what an example `Application` file would look like with Code Fences
applied.

```elixir
defmodule MyBaseApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      MyBaseAppWeb.Endpoint,
      {Phoenix.PubSub, name: MyBaseApp.PubSub},
      MyBaseAppWeb.Presence,
      MyBaseAppWeb.Telemetry,

      # uniform:lib:my_first_data_lib
      MyFirstDataLib.Repo,
      # /uniform:lib:my_first_data_lib

      # uniform:lib:my_second_data_lib
      MySecondDataLib.Repo,
      MySecondDataLib.Vault,
      # /uniform:lib:my_second_data_lib

      # uniform:remove
      SomeDevelopmentOnlyDB.Repo,
      # /uniform:remove

      # uniform:mix:oban
      {Oban, ...},
      # /uniform:mix:oban
    ]

    # ...
  end
end
```

Notice that code which should always be ejected does not get surrounded by Code
Fences.

### mix.exs

Some dependencies require modifying `mix.exs`. For example, the
[exq](https://hexdocs.pm/exq) Hex package says to add `:exq` to `application`
in `mix.exs`.

```elixir
def application do
  [
    applications: [:logger, :exq],
    # ...
  ]
end
```

But what if only some of your apps require exq? Wrap the exq-specific code in
Code Fences, and it will only be included when exq is required.

```elixir
def application do
  [
    applications: [
      :logger,
      # uniform:mix:exq
      :exq
      # /uniform:mix:exq
    ],
    # ...
  ]
end
```

#### You don't need to use Code Fences in `deps` {: .tip}

Note that removing deps from the `deps` section of `mix.exs` is automatic if
you follow the [Getting Started](getting-started.html) instructions properly.

So this would not be required.

    # ❌ Do NOT wrap deps in code fences
    defp deps do
      [
        # uniform:mix:jason
        {:jason, "~> 1.0"}
        # /uniform:mix:jason
      ]
    end

### Config Files

Many dependencies also require configuration. Apply code fences in your
configuration files for the same result.

```elixir
# uniform:mix:guardian
config :my_base_app, MyBaseApp.Guardian,
       issuer: "my_base_app",
       secret_key: ...
# /uniform:mix:guardian
```
